## ABOUT_AUTHOR

VT Rushi Kannan is a research enthusiast specializing in sentiment analysis, financial text mining, and deep learning classification systems. He completed a Summer Research Internship at the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Kottayam, where he developed expertise in natural language processing and machine learning applications for social media analytics. His recent contribution to the CryptOQA Shared Task at FIRE 2025 (IIT BHU Varanasi) involved designing and implementing a sophisticated dual-level opinion extraction system for cryptocurrency-related social media data. Currently, he is exploring advanced ensemble methods and hierarchical classification approaches, and is open to research collaborations and internship opportunities in the field of NLP and financial AI.

## PROJECT_DESC

This system was developed for the CryptOQA Track at FIRE 2025. It performs multi-level opinion classification on Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube data and provides a real-time interactive demo through this web interface. The platform features live visualization of confidence scores and hierarchical classification labels, enabling users to understand the model's decision-making process at each level of the sentiment analysis pipeline.
